### Introduction to Data Analytics

### What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics refers to the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making. It involves various techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, to identify patterns and trends.

### The Role of a Data Analyst

A Data Analyst is responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing data to help businesses make informed decisions. Their key responsibilities include:

Extracting data from databases and other sources

Cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format

Performing statistical analysis and generating reports

Visualizing data using dashboards and charts

Communicating insights to stakeholders

### Career Paths & Industry Demand

Data Analysts are in high demand across various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and technology. Some common career paths include:

Business Intelligence Analyst â€“ Specializes in reporting and dashboard creation

Marketing Analyst â€“ Focuses on customer behavior and market trends

Financial Analyst â€“ Works with financial data for investment decisions

Data Scientist â€“ Uses advanced analytics and machine learning to predict trends

Product Analyst â€“ Analyzes user engagement and product performance

### Understanding Data & Analytics

Types of Data (Structured vs. Unstructured)

Structured Data â€“ Organized data stored in relational databases, such as tables with predefined fields (e.g., Excel sheets, SQL databases).

Unstructured Data â€“ Data without a predefined structure, including text, images, videos, and social media posts.

Semi-structured Data â€“ A mix of both, like JSON and XML files.

### Basics of Databases & Data Storage

Relational Databases (RDBMS) â€“ Uses structured tables and SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

NoSQL Databases â€“ Handles unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

Cloud Storage & Data Lakes â€“ Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for handling large datasets.

### Key Analytics Tools & Technologies

Data Manipulation & Querying â€“ SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization â€“ Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Big Data Technologies â€“ Hadoop, Spark

Machine Learning Basics â€“ Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for advanced analysts)

Cloud & Collaboration Tools â€“ Google BigQuery, AWS, GitHub

This foundational phase sets the stage for more advanced topics in data analysis, helping students build a strong base in understanding data structures, industry applications, and essential tools.
