### Introduction to Data Analytics

### What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics refers to the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making. It involves various techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, to identify patterns and trends.

### The Role of a Data Analyst

A Data Analyst is responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing data to help businesses make informed decisions. Their key responsibilities include:

Extracting data from databases and other sources

Cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format

Performing statistical analysis and generating reports

Visualizing data using dashboards and charts

Communicating insights to stakeholders

### Career Paths & Industry Demand

Data Analysts are in high demand across various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and technology. Some common career paths include:

Business Intelligence Analyst – Specializes in reporting and dashboard creation

Marketing Analyst – Focuses on customer behavior and market trends

Financial Analyst – Works with financial data for investment decisions

Data Scientist – Uses advanced analytics and machine learning to predict trends

Product Analyst – Analyzes user engagement and product performance

### Understanding Data & Analytics

Types of Data (Structured vs. Unstructured)

Structured Data – Organized data stored in relational databases, such as tables with predefined fields (e.g., Excel sheets, SQL databases).

Unstructured Data – Data without a predefined structure, including text, images, videos, and social media posts.

Semi-structured Data – A mix of both, like JSON and XML files.

### Basics of Databases & Data Storage

Relational Databases (RDBMS) – Uses structured tables and SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

NoSQL Databases – Handles unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

Cloud Storage & Data Lakes – Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for handling large datasets.

### Key Analytics Tools & Technologies

Data Manipulation & Querying – SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization – Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Big Data Technologies – Hadoop, Spark

Machine Learning Basics – Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for advanced analysts)

Cloud & Collaboration Tools – Google BigQuery, AWS, GitHub

This foundational phase sets the stage for more advanced topics in data analysis, helping students build a strong base in understanding data structures, industry applications, and essential tools.
