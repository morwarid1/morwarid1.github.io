1. Introduction to Python
Why Python for Data Analysis?
Setting up the Python environment (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code)
Python basics: Variables, Data Types, Loops, Functions, and Conditionals
Introduction to libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
2. Pandas for Data Manipulation
Series and DataFrames
Importing and Exporting Data (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL)
Data Selection, Filtering, and Indexing
Data Aggregation with groupby
Pivot Tables in Pandas
Applying functions with apply and map
Merging and Joining datasets
3. NumPy for Numerical Analysis
Understanding Arrays vs. Lists
Creating and Manipulating NumPy Arrays
Indexing, Slicing, and Reshaping Arrays
Vectorized Operations and Broadcasting
Basic Statistical Operations (mean, median, standard deviation)
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn for Data Visualization
Introduction to Data Visualization
Creating Line, Bar, and Scatter Plots in Matplotlib
Styling and Customizing Matplotlib Charts
Using Seaborn for Advanced Visualizations
Pairplots, Boxplots, Violin Plots, Heatmaps
Customizing Seaborn Visualizations for better storytelling
5. Data Cleaning & Transformation with Python
Handling missing values (dropna(), fillna())
Detecting and Removing Duplicates
Data Type Conversion
String Manipulation in Pandas
Feature Engineering Techniques
6. Data Wrangling Techniques
Reshaping Data: melt() and pivot()
Working with Time Series Data
Dealing with Outliers
Data Normalization and Standardization
Encoding Categorical Variables
7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding Data Distribution
Identifying Patterns & Trends
Correlation Analysis
Summary Statistics with Pandas
Using Visualizations for Insights (histograms, pairplots, heatmaps)
Project: Real-World Data Analysis
Students will work on a dataset (e.g., COVID-19 data, Instacart, Netflix, or an open dataset)
Perform data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and exploratory analysis
Present insights using a Jupyter Notebook or PowerPoint
