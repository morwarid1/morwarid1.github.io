Welcome to **Phase 2** of your data journey! In this module, we explore two of the most powerful and accessible tools in a data analyst’s toolkit: **Microsoft Excel** and **Google Sheets**. Whether you're prepping raw data or creating dynamic dashboards, this guide will help you master it all.

## 1️⃣ Fundamental Functions & Formulas

Familiarize yourself with the **Excel/Sheets interface** and master foundational functions:

- 🔢 **Basic Functions**: `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `IF`, `TEXT`, `CONCATENATE`
- 🔍 **Lookup & Reference**: `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `XLOOKUP`
- 🎯 **Conditional Logic**: `IF`, `IFERROR`, `AND`, `OR`
- 📊 **Aggregation**: `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, `AVERAGEIFS`

💡 **Pro Tip**: Use `INDEX-MATCH` instead of `VLOOKUP` for more flexibility and performance.

## 2️⃣ Pivot Tables & Data Analysis

**Pivot Tables** are your best friend when it comes to summarizing large datasets.

- Create dynamic pivot tables in Excel/Sheets  
- Group, filter, and sort data efficiently  
- Add calculated fields for extra insights  
- Build pivot charts for visual storytelling  

⚙️ Use pivot tables to identify trends, patterns, and outliers quickly.

## 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Formatting Best Practices

Dirty data? Not anymore! Learn how to clean and prep your dataset like a pro:

- ❌ Remove duplicates and blanks  
- 🔤 Standardize text with `TRIM`, `CLEAN`, `PROPER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`  
- ✂️ Use **Text to Columns** and **Flash Fill** for quick splitting/merging  
- ✅ Apply **Data Validation** for consistent inputs  
- 🧹 Leverage **Power Query** for large-scale data transformations  

---

## 4️⃣ Conditional Formatting & Data Validation

Make your data more **visual and reliable**:

- 🎨 Apply color scales, data bars, and icon sets  
- 🧠 Build custom rules with formulas  
- 🔽 Create drop-down lists and dependent lists  
- 🧯 Use error checking to prevent bad data entries  

🎯 Great formatting makes your data easier to read and analyze at a glance.

### 📈 Dashboards & Reports

Take your reporting skills to the next level:

- Build **interactive dashboards** with slicers & timelines  
- Use a variety of charts: line, bar, scatter, waterfall  
- Connect to **live data sources** for real-time reporting  

---

### 🧰 Power Query for Data Transformation

Master Excel's built-in ETL tool:

- Import & merge multiple datasets  
- Clean & reshape data with Power Query Editor  
- Automate refreshes for up-to-date reports  

---

### 🤖 Automate Tasks with Macros

Streamline your workflow with automation:

- Record and edit **Macros** to reduce repetitive work  
- Get started with **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**  
- Automate routine data cleaning or formatting tasks  

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

By the end of this phase, you’ll be equipped to clean, analyze, and present data confidently using spreadsheets. In **Phase 3**, we’ll dive into **SQL for data extraction and querying.**

## Project: "Monthly KPI Dashboard for an E-Commerce Store"

Objectives:

- Use dummy data (sales, customers, product returns)

- Apply formulas like VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIFS

- Create pivot tables and slicers

- Design a dashboard using charts (bar, line, pie)

- Bonus: Add automation using simple Macros or Google App Script

> **Consistency is key — the more you practice, the more fluent you’ll become in spreadsheets.**
