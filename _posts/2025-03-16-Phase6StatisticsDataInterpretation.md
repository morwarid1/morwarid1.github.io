Welcome to **Phase 6** of your data journey! Understanding **statistics** is crucial for turning data into confident, data-driven decisions. In this phase, you'll learn the fundamentals of descriptive and inferential statistics, A/B testing, and predictive modeling through regression.

## 1️⃣ Descriptive & Inferential Statistics

### 📊 Descriptive Statistics

Start by summarizing and understanding your data:

- **Measures of Central Tendency**  
  - `Mean`, `Median`, `Mode`  
- **Measures of Dispersion**  
  - `Range`, `Variance`, `Standard Deviation`  
- Understand **distribution shapes**: `Skewness`, `Kurtosis`

### 📈 Inferential Statistics

Go beyond the data you have to make broader assumptions:

- **Probability Distributions**  
  - Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential  
- **Statistical Significance**  
  - Understanding **p-values**, **confidence levels**, and **hypothesis testing**  
- Formulating and testing assumptions about populations

## 2️⃣ A/B Testing & Confidence Intervals

Test business ideas and product changes with confidence.

### 🧪 A/B Testing

- What is A/B testing and why it matters  
- Formulate **null** and **alternative hypotheses**  
- Determine appropriate **sample sizes**  
- Understand and manage:
  - **Type I Error (False Positive)**  
  - **Type II Error (False Negative)**

### 📏 Confidence Intervals

- How to calculate and interpret confidence intervals  
- The impact of **sample size** and **data variance**  
- Use CIs to quantify uncertainty in your results

## 3️⃣ Regression & Predictive Analysis

Use **regression models** to forecast trends and predict outcomes.

### 🔢 Linear & Logistic Regression

- Simple & Multiple **Linear Regression**  
  - Predict continuous outcomes  
- **Logistic Regression** for classification problems  
  - Predict binary outcomes like "yes/no", "churn/stay"

### 🔍 Feature Selection & Model Evaluation

- Identify important predictors  
- Avoid **multicollinearity** using techniques like VIF  
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - `R²`, `RMSE` for regression  
  - `Precision`, `Recall`, `AUC-ROC` for classification

## 💼 Practical Business Use Cases

Apply what you've learned in real-world scenarios:

- 📈 **Sales Forecasting** – Use linear regression to predict revenue  
- 🔁 **Customer Churn Prediction** – Use logistic regression for classification  
- 🧪 **A/B Test Analysis** – Combine hypothesis testing with regression insights

## 🎯 What’s Next?

By the end of this phase, you’ll be able to apply statistical methods to validate ideas, evaluate experiments, and build predictive models. In **Phase 7**, we’ll explore how to apply these concepts in a full **end-to-end capstone project**.

> *Statistics is the grammar of data. Master it, and you’ll speak data fluently.*
