“THE GOAL IS TO TURN DATA INTO INFORMATION AND INFORMATION INTO INSIGHT.”


    
    
#### About Me
My name is Morwarid Najafizada. I am a self-directed certified Data Analyst from CareerFoundry boot camp with Bachelor's Degree in Business Analytics from Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa. I call myself a passionate Data Analyst because I love problem-solving, analyzing, and researching data. I love this field because it allows me to be creative with the data. I find the process very engaging and satisfactory because I get to showcase my result at the end. I am experienced in machine learning, supervised and unsupervise algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, and Tableau for my data projects. 

I have volunteered in different organizations. I was applauded for being a detail-oriented and innovative employee. Now, I am ready to contribute my skills as a passionate Data Analyst to make data-driven decisions and add value for the cross-functional business teams.
